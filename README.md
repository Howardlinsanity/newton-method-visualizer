# What is it?
Newton's Method is a mathematical procedure used to approximate the zeroes of a function given an initial value

# How does it work?
Using an initial point, it will calculate the tangent line of the function at that point and find the x-intercept of the tangent line. The process then iteratively uses that x-intercept as the next value, we find the tangent line of that value in the function, repeat, etc. It's a Numerical Method, more can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method

# Dependencies
All that is required so far is that you have python3 installed

# Running application
Run `python3 main.py`
